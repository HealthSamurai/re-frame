## 1.4.4 (2024-06-24)

#### Changed

    - Changed flows to calculate the new app-db earlier in the chain.
      - Benefit:  user-defined interceptors can access post-flow app-db value.
      - Drawback: they can't access the value of app-db directly resulting from the event handler.
      - Drawback: they can't access flow-related effects like `:reg-flow`.

    - Added a :re-frame/pre-flow-db key to the context
      - This way, user-defined interceptors can still access the app-db value resulting directly from the event handler.

## 1.4.3 (2024-01-25)

#### Fixed

    - cljdoc analysis & build errors (see https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc/issues/853)
